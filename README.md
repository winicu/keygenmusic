## How to use
### Windows
Please download [OpenMPT](https://openmpt.org/) to open `.xm/.s3m/.mod/.it` music files.  <br>
For `.mid` files, it's recommended to use Windows Media Player.<br>
**It's NOT recommended to use Furnace, as it's more focus on the chiptune side, and there are pieces KNOWN breaks with Furnace.** <br>
